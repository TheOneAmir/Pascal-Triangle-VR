# Pascal-Triangle-VR 
A 3D VR render of the first five levels of Pascal's pyramid hosted on Github. </br>
https://theoneamir.github.io/Pascal-Triangle-VR/ 

# Purpose
There are many online representations of Pascal's Triangle but not many of the pyramid form. So, this is an experimental rendition for the joy of number theory. 

# Details 
The project uses a modified version of React VR Walk from: https://github.com/apoeco/react-vr-walk </br>
Controls: </br>
A: Move west </br>
S: Move south </br>
D: Move east </br>
W: Move north </br>
E: Move up </br>
X: Move down </br>
